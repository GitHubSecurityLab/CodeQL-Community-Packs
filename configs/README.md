# Community Configurations

## Default / CodeQL

The `codeql.yml` configuration is the default config file used to make it easy to use the CodeQL Community Packs.

## Audit

The `audit.yml` configuration is used primary to audit code by running a number of audit queries with CodeQL.
These are based on the suite in each language suites folder called `{LANG}-audit.qls`

> [!NOTE]
> Current Ruby and Swift are not supported
