# Use this query suite when looking to get the broadest coverage of security results from the CodeQL Built in packs and the GitHub Security Lab Community packs.
# WARNING: A notable amount of false positives may be found in this configuration.  If you wish to reduce the number of false positives, use the default codeql suites :)
# NOTE: This suite will not include audit level queries intended for gathering information about the codebase, and debugging queries intended for CodeQL developers.
# NOTE: A suite cannot exclude directories from the scan.  Consider pairing with a codeql-config.yml that excludes unwanted folders with `paths-ignore`
# NOTE: A suite cannot include library packs that contain data extensions.  Consider pairing with a codeql-config.yml that includes needed data models.
